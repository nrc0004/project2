Technologies Used: Ruby on rails, heroku, html, CSS

Instructions: Once you load up the site, you will need to create a username and password to access the app. Once you are in, you will be propted to create a profile that will allow you to interact with the rest of the FIT community.

Once you have done that, you can redirect to the main page and begin accessing fitness programs created by other members, edit programs you created, add exercises to programs, edit your profile, and see others in the FIT community.

Unsolved issues : Due to multiple upload errors, I was unable to deploy on heroku like I had planned.
